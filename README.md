# Popular Movies

A training project in the Android Developer Nanodegree program made by Udacity and Google.

###About the application:
The project uses the [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) to get the different details of the films to present.


On the main screen, the posters of the different films are returned by the choice of the user, which can be by:
- Popularity
- Rating
- List of favorites.

Tapping on the poster, the user is moved to the details screen where the basic movie details are presented, with trailers and reviews. Here the user can save/delete the movie from the "Favorites" local database. A custom content provider is implemented to make the different interactions on it. 

###Used libraries:
- Android API 26,
- Retrofit2,
- ButterKnife.
